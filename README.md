React-Based App and Tooling to Teach Front-End Automation with Cypress

## What's this project do?

This project presents a simple, example app front end written with React-Bootstrap and tooling to provide testing resources for this app front end. 

This will eventuall include things like Storybook support for displaying/testing components as well as unit tests and Cypress.

The goal is to provide an example app and the stubs of the test tooling to build a comprehensive test suite for the app.  

Users can then follow the prompts that will be included to fulfill testing efforts and in the process, become familiar with writing and running
automated tests for front end applications built with React.  

To Dos: 
1. Implement Storybook'd Components
2. Write example unit test for each component
3. Write Stubs for component unit tests (to be filled out by user)
4. Stand up Cypress test stubs for use with Storybook (1-2 example tests, stubs to be handled by user)
5. Stand up stand-alone integration test stubs with Cypress
6. Clean up components
